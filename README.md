# Python-100-Days-of-Code-Bootcamp
I'm taking an udemy course for Python development: https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@4fjoXR0yP_eeiBiDtjWEbaY4rIMbZoszbXlW9WtFMS0mVPLLSVYsX1SSwJInDK_p/

There's nothing crazy in here, just my solutions to the problems in the course.
But... take it as proof that I at least know how to write Python I suppose.
